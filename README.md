### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github. I was not using very much on the past, triyng to change it now ðŸ˜…

I will use this as a learning space, where I will post the things I'm studying, my learning projects, and things I just find cool. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Tivita
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning backend languages and devops
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming during a bootcamp I made when I was at civil engineering college
- ðŸ“« To reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitorstoledo/ or pr.vitortoledo@gmail.com
