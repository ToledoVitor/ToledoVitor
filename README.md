### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I will use this as a learning space, where I will post the things I'm studying, my learning projects, and things I just find cool. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Pulse - Mateus Mais

- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming during a bootcamp I made when I was at civil engineering college
